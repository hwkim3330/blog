Welcome to NXP Semiconductors.

Hello,
I’m currently evaluating 802.1CB (FRER – Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability) functionality across different platforms.
10:51:19 AM
We are also working with the NXP GoldBox (S32G-based), and I’d like to ask:

Does the GoldBox platform support IEEE 802.1CB, including stream identification, replication, and elimination functions?

Are there any example configurations, documentation, or YANG models available to test or implement 802.1CB on the GoldBox system?

Any information or pointers (e.g., Linux drivers, SDK support, TSN examples) would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
