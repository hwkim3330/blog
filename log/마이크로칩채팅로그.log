Hi my name is Erwin. How can I assist you?
Erwin
hello
about lan9692
E
Hi Hyunwoo, what is the concern with this device?
Erwin
Hello,
I'm currently working with the LAN9692 board and would like to confirm whether it supports IEEE 802.1CB (Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability).

Specifically, could you please provide any documentation, manuals, or example configurations related to 802.1CB support on this board?

If 802.1CB is not supported yet, is there a roadmap or planned support for this feature in future firmware releases?

Thank you.
E
Let me check this details for a moment. Please wait for a while.

I’ve reviewed the latest VelocityDRIVE-SP 2025.06 documentation and noticed that the LAN9692 board supports stream identification mechanisms aligned with IEEE 802.1CB (e.g., Null, SMAC, and IP-based identification).

I would like to confirm:

Does the current firmware fully support IEEE 802.1CB, including frame replication and elimination mechanisms (FRER)?

If not fully supported yet, is FRER support (e.g., sequence generation, elimination, recovery) planned for future firmware versions?

Are there any example configurations or test scenarios demonstrating complete 802.1CB functionality on the LAN9692 board?

Thank you in advance for your support.

Thank you for waiting.

It seems that the LAN9692 document does not mention 802.1CB as feature. Though, I would suggest to create a technical support ticket instead so that our device specialist can answer more of your questions.

Would that be great?

Thank you for your reply.

I understand that 802.1CB is not officially listed in the documentation, but I noticed that the 2025.06 VelocityDRIVE-SP version includes the YANG path /ieee802-dot1cb-stream-identification:stream-identity, along with detailed examples for Null, SMAC, and IP stream identification.

Given this, I’d like to clarify:

Does the current firmware already support stream identification features as defined in IEEE 802.1CB, and if so, does it also support frame replication and elimination (FRER)?

Is there a plan to officially document or update the VelocityDRIVE-SP manual to reflect this feature (802.1CB), including usage and limitations?

If it's better to raise this via a technical support ticket, I’m happy to do so. I just wanted to confirm the current implementation status and any upcoming documentation updates.

Thanks again for your support.

I would highly suggest opening a ticket for this one Hyunwoo. By the way, since you are from Korea, you may contact your local office if you prefer.
